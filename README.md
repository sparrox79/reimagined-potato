Here is my request...I would like to apply a 2 stages kmeans clustering to my data file. The first step is to build three classes according to 2 columns only and then rebuild more files to redo a second step of kmeans ( 5 clusters in step 2 for each cluster obtained in step 1). In total I wuld get 3 * 5 = 15 clusters.
